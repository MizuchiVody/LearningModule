## MultipleFeeds 2.0 intial simple code
By Farouk:
 * using bindings I display the camera feed on demand
## MultipleFeeds 2.0 (still working on it)
By Farouk: 
 * I use a method that is responsible only for creating two labels one above the other with different size. 
 * As arguments to this method I pass which feed to be displayed as main and which one as sub. 
 * I will try to do it with bindings.
 * as a base for the two feeds I will use Aghzal's code.
